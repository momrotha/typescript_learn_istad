// enum use for constants beacause it is not changeable, Example a week has 7 days, so we can use enum to define the days of the week.

// declare enum for days of the week
enum week {
    Sunday,
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday

}
console.table([week]);
